Introduction
This project demonstrates a low-cost electronic ventilator prototype using an Arduino and a plastic respiratory bag. It uses an LCD to display the ventilator's status and a servo motor to automate the operation of the respiratory bag, ensuring affordable and accessible respiratory support.

Features
Servo-controlled plastic respiratory bag to simulate lung operation.
LCD interface displaying real-time updates (e.g., elapsed time, device information).
Compact and cost-effective design.
Simple Arduino-based implementation for educational and emergency use.
Hardware Requirements
To build this ventilator, you'll need the following components:

Arduino Uno (or compatible board).
Servo motor (e.g., SG90 or equivalent).
Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) 16x2.
Resistors and jumper wires.
Breadboard or PCB.
Plastic respiratory bag.
Power source (e.g., 9V battery or USB).
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (latest version recommended)
Libraries:
LiquidCrystal
Servo
Getting Started
Hardware Setup
Connect the servo motor to pin 9 of the Arduino.
Interface the 16x2 LCD display with the Arduino using pins 2-5, 11, and 12.
Ensure proper connections between power, ground, and the plastic respiratory bag.
Assemble the system on a breadboard or mount it on a PCB.
Software Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/ventilator-project.git
Open ventilator.ino in the Arduino IDE.
Install necessary libraries via the Arduino Library Manager.
Upload the code to your Arduino board.
Code Overview
The system has three main functionalities:

Controlling the servo motor to automate the compression of the respiratory bag.
Displaying messages and real-time updates on the LCD screen.
Using simple loops for motor control with adjustable timings.
Key code sections:

Servo Initialization:

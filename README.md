# Low-Cost Electronic Ventilator using Arduino

This project is a low-cost electronic ventilator designed for medical emergencies, especially in resource-constrained environments. The device automates the compression and release of a plastic respiratory bag (Ambu bag) using a servo motor controlled by an Arduino, ensuring consistent airflow delivery to patients in need of respiratory assistance.
